Shown are results from tosses of cylindrical "dice".


All cylinders have radius 1 inch.

Six have height 1/2 inch, six 3/4 inch, and six 1 inch.


The first square of numbers record the
results of 25 tossings of all six 1/2 inch cylinders.

Shown are the number of cylinders lying on 
their 'side' (as opposed to their two 'ends').


The second square of numbers record the
results for 25 tossings fo the 3/4 inch cylinders.

The bottom square shows the 1 inch cylinders.


The goal is to estimate what height gives a 
one third chance for the cylinder to land on
its side.
